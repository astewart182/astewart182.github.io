# Hi!

Thanks for checking out my site. This is where I host my resume and some of my past projects to showcase my skills and knowledge.

### About me:
I am currently an occupational health researcher at the University of Miami, and I specialize in data analysis. I love taking raw data and working to convert it into something that I can use to better the lives of others. 
I currently do research regarding reducing cancer risk for firefighters, and work to leverage this research to improve their health and safety practices.
